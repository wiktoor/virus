Program for my *C++* class. Our goal was to use modern C++ features such as smart pointers ([std::unique_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr), [std::shared_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr), [std::weak_ptr](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr)) to manage memory properly. In addition, we had to maintain exception safety (using techniques such as rollbacking).
